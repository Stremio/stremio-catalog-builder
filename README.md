# Stremio Catalog Builder

View demo at: https://stremio.github.io/stremio-catalog-builder/

The purpose of this project is to allow Stremio users to highly customise their Movie / Series catalogs based on their interests and popular lists.

It allows users to select from a large list of List Names and Interests (which are based on hardcoded IMDB Lists and Tags).

After selecting the List Names and Interests you would like, pressing "Generate" will create a 1 hour temporary link to a catalog of addons based on the selections.

The addon catalog is opened in Stremio through the `stremio://` protocol.
